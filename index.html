          <h2>3. Work Experience</h2>
          <h3>HNI</h3>
          <p>
            During the summer of 2024, I worked as a Product Marketing Intern at
            HNI Workplace Furnishings in Muscatine, IA, where I performed
            financial and competitive analysis for the company's conference
            table lines. My research helped identify gaps in product offerings
            and opportunities for new product development. Additionally, I
            analyzed market trends to propose improvements for HNI’s conference
            table products and assisted in creating a slide deck to enhance the
            sales team’s understanding of product features and benefits.

          <h3>Clinton Street Market</h3>
          <p>
            Since February 2022, I have been a Store Lead at Clinton Street
            Market in Iowa City, IA. In this role, I coordinate assignments
            among team members to optimize store operations, monitor inventory
            levels to meet demand while minimizing shortages, and foster
            collaboration among coworkers to ensure timely and efficient
            service.
          </p>

          <h3>Kwik Star</h3>
          <p>
            Previously, I worked as a Store Associate at Kwik Star in Muscatine,
            IA, from May 2022 to January 2023. I gained expertise in cash
            handling, ensuring secure financial transactions while providing
            excellent customer service. Additionally, I oversaw food
            preparation, ensuring appropriate portioning to minimize waste.

          <h3>Delta Sigma Pi</h3>
          <p>
            I have been involved in a number of student organizations but the
            main one is my business fraternity; Delta Sigma Pi (DSP). In DSP I
            have held a few leadership positions. I served as a Corporate
            Relations Chair where I helped plan our private career fair and our
            semesterly professional trip. I served on the executive board as VP
            of Scholarship and Awards where I kept track of members' attendance
            and controlled our bank account. I also was on the interview
            committee where I interviewed prospective new members.
