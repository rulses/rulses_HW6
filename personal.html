          <h2>1. About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of school and my professional experience, I have many
            hobbies. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, watching and
            playing sports, and traveling.

          <h2>2. Sports</h2>
          <p>
            In my free time I enjoy sports. In high school, I played football,
            basketball, and baseball. Nowadays, I stay active in intramural
            sports. I have played basketball, flag football, and indoor and sand
            volleyball. I also enjoy watching sports. Some of my favorite teams
            are the Iowa Hawkeyes (of course), the Dallas Cowboys, and the
            Boston Celtics.

          <h2>3. Travel</h2>
          <p>
            I also enjoying traveling. Every year my family goes on a trip to
            Orange Beach, Alabama, which is a lot of fun. In spring of 2024, I
            traveled to St. George, Utah and went to Zion National Park. In the
            summer of 2023, I went on a month long trip to Spain and Portugal.
            For two weeks of the trip, I hiked about 150 miles as part of the
            Camino de Santiago. If you are unfamilar with the Camino you can
            read more about it
            <a href="https://santiago-compostela.net/">here</a>! This trip was
            the most impactful and amazing thing I've gotten to experience.
